So 2020 brought us a big change called COVID-19, a gigantic reset one may call it. Everyone around the world was forced into thinking differently.

For myself 2020 equalled to loosing my company due to a lot of rules and unfairness around this, don’t really want to make this post solely about loosing my companies. It mainly had to do with being stuck in a foreign country then where the companies should’ve been operated for a period over 6 months. So this was the ‘good news’ I got approximately in the second half of 2020, I’ve lost my legacy. Well as entrepreneurial as I’m a thought well instead of me feeling bad and doing nothing… let’s focus on getting a “job” even if this is just as a contractor.

This job I found after many many applications, It was a Tier1 network restructuring to working from anywhere instead of working from fixed locations - I do applaud to this. However my employment in this shop was rather short (6 weeks) for reasons still not known to me - so I end up guessing what the real reason was as there was never an proper exit interview or HR related talks - I was working Wednesday and fired on a Thursday. I just noticed none of my accounts where no longer working… but hey… welcome to my world. 

My observations of the workforce and the task I was loaded with gave me motivation to actually start working on my own education CCDE/CCIE SP & JNCIE-CLOUD and JNCIE-DC again for fun and giggles. It was the result of me teaching others, call this a positive. 

However currently mainly due to none sufficient funding (as I’m unemployed currently) proceeding with anything of the above list doesn’t really appear to be super useful - However I need todo something so I decided to-do some AWS related trainings on my INE account I still have access to. 
However now back to being rejected because I’m too qualified for a job, I’m not stopping to apply for various positions at various companies (Amazon, Cisco, Juniper amongst “bigger” networks again) as I’m truly lost what should be my next career move.

I enjoy training people I do, I have 15+ years of experience currently mainly in (Large) Enterprise & Service Providers networks.

So this was a little rant about what happened to me, now let’s go to the observations of trend for 2020-2021.

One of the trends I applaud to:
- Working from Home : We’re not chair fillers management.
- Flexibility : As a result of working from home, one can now in good chat with his/her manager and perhaps by him/her-self work on flexible schedule and with this create a greater work-life balance. 
- Diversity : I see workforces hiring more females, however in my opinion and this is yet something that should be the next big thing we just not need to try and match gender ‘numbers’ but we need to find the best person for the job. It should never be about numbers but about the best person doing the job.

The downside of the coin would be:
- Lazy employees : Able to just slip through the mazes of the net. 
- Lower ‘drive’ for excellence : This within a lot of companies and also the Tier1 I’ve worked for comes as a result of a lacking Senior / Technical Lead whom can guide the young wolfs through the night.

So where I do applaud to working from home, it also means companies should facilitate the eager workers in the ability to better themselves.

For myself I think I want a job as either Technical Marketing Engineer or Head of IP Networks within a decent sized provider.
