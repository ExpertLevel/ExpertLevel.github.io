My name is Elena Steehouwer, before getting married I was born as Elena Osadchaya.

After working years in the hospitality business and the big reset named Covid-19. I decided to change my life into becoming a network engineer.

Currently pursuing for 2021:
- CCNP Enterprise Infrastructure;
- JNCIA-JUNOS & JNCIS-SP.

My contributions to this blog will be about becoming an Expert level Network Engineer by first establishing solid foundations as my [husband](/about/wesley) finds these very important.
